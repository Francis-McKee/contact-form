# contact-form

This is a barebones contact form created with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). When the user fills out the form and submits it, I will recieve an email and can then contact the person directly. The free Formspree plan allows for up to 50 submissions a month.

Below is an example of what the email you recieve will look like. Remember, because the HTML is customizable, the fields and their names will also be customizable.
